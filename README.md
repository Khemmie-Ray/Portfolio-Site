## Portfolio Site

A personal portfolio site to showcase my skills, past projects and experiences as a frontend developer who is interested in the potentials of Web3 and blockchain technologies. The design was created to look like a magazine with a coverpage and then the inner pages. I am open to feedback and constructive criticism on how to make this better.
